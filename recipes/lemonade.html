        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Lemonade: sugar, water, lemon juice. Easy, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, the problem is that if you just stir all of these together the sugar will sink to the bottom. So the best way to make lemonade is to make a simple syrup first, by heating water and sugar together until the sugar is completely dissolved, and then mix that with the lemon juice.
        </p>
        <p>
            The proportions will vary depending on how sweet and strong you like your lemonade, and how sour your lemons are to begin with. Late season lemons are less sour than early season lemons. Meyer lemons are sweeter than standard lemons.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup sugar (can reduce to 3/4 cup)</li>
            <li>1 cup water (for the simple syrup)</li>
            <li>1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 to 3 cups cold water, to dilute</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Make the simple syrup: Place the sugar and water in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Stir so that the sugar dissolves completely and remove from heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Juice the lemons:While the water is heating for the simple syrup, juice your lemons. Depending on the size of the lemons, 4 to 6 of them should be enough for 1 cup of juice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix the lemonade: Pour the juice and the simple syrup sugar water into a serving pitcher. Add 2 to 3 cups of cold water and taste. Add more water if you would like it to be more diluted (though note that when you add ice, it will melt and naturally dilute the lemonade). If the lemonade is a little sweet for your taste, add a little more straight lemon juice to it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Chill and serve: Refrigerate 30 to 40 minutes. Serve with ice and sliced lemons.
            </li>
